# Hello World
My name is Daniel Cao.  Welcome to my GitHub homepage showcasing my Computer Science projects!

I graduated in January 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from [California
State University, Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) with a 3.64 grade point average.

In January 2024, I am enrolled at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) for their Master of Science in Computer Science program.
