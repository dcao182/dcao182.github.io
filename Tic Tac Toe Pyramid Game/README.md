# CPSC-481-Final-Project

**Contributors: Andy Cao, Daniel Cao, Ariadne Rincon**    
This project was created for our CPSC 481 class    
Spring '22 semester.  
This program is a variation of the infamous Tic-Tac-Toe game, but   
displays the game in a Pyramid shape instead of the standard 3x3.  

**How to Play (tic tac toe rules):**       
    -Players take turn placing their marker on an empty square (either X or O)    
    -Win by placing 3 of your markers in a row   
        -Diagonally  
        -Up  
        -Down  
        -Across  
    -Game ends with a winner, or when all spaces are taken by a marker  

**Here are some examples of winning moves:**
